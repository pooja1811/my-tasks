# My tasks Dashboard

My tasks dashboard along with Login functionality using VueJs in the UI, NodeJs for the APIs and LokiJs for a fast in-memory document-oriented database

## Installation

Use the node package manager to install dependencies.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

## Usage

Run the following commands on two different terminal instances to start the Vue and Node servers.

```bash
npm run frontend
```

```bash
npm run backend
```

No separate configuration required for LokiJs.

Use http://localhost:8080/ to load the Login page of the project.
